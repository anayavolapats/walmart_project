# Framing the problem
## Problem Statement
"Increase Walmart's Holiday Season Revenue Through Data-Driven Pricing Strategy Optimization" 
## Problem Description
Walmart optimizes price methods in order to increase sales throughout the Christmas season. The initiative intends to use previous sales data to provide insights and suggestions for setting markdowns effectively in order to accomplish this goal. The following are the main goals: 
### Analysis of the provided historical data: 
Determine any trends or patterns by analyzing historical data from departments, features, holiday dates, stores, and test data from prior holiday seasons (Labor Day, Super Bowl, Christmas, and Thanksgiving), keeping in mind that the data is incomplete. 
### Sales Forecasting
Create predictive models that take into account multiple elements like temperature, gasoline prices, and past performance to forecast future holiday season sales.  
Calculate each product segment's demand elasticity and price sensitivity. 
### Development of the pricing strategy
Offer markdown and discount tactics that are in line with projected sales and profit margins. 
### Data analysis visualisation 
Create dashboards and reports to give Walmart's decision-makers an accurate picture of past and future holiday season sales, price, and markdown suggestions. 

## Expected Outcomes
The client will ultimately be able to optimize markdowns and price tactics after receiving the work, which will result in more sales and improved consumer satisfaction during the crucial holiday shopping season.
